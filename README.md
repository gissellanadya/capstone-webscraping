# Web Scraping, Data Wrangling, and Flask Dashboard (Case Study: IMDB)

Greetings all! My name is `Gissella Nadya` and this is my submission / capstone project for `Data Analysis Specialization`, specifically in Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup, Data Wrangling, and Implementing to Flask Dashboard for Algorit.ma Data Science School. I choose `IMDB` as my case study because I am passionate about Movies and TV shows. So let's start coding!

## Dependencies

Please make sure you have this library installed in your environment, as we are going to use it:

- BeautifulSoup4
- Flask
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

# Goals

The goal for this project is to find the `Top 7 Films/TV Shows released from 01-01-2019 until 31-12-2019 shown on IMDB`, sorted through their `popularity`. We are going to inspect the ratings, metascores, as well as the votes that they've received! 

# Steps

I have decided to divided this project into 7 steps, those are:

1. Step 1: Requesting the Data and Creating the BeautifulSoup
2. Step 2: Finding the right key to scrap the data 
3. Step 3: Extracting the right information
4. Step 4: Let's start the Scrapping Process!
5. Step 5: Creating data frame & Data wrangling
6. Step 6: Implementing your webscrapping to the Flask dashboard
7. Step 7: Finishing This Notebook with Your Analysis and Conclusion

That's all about the technical stuff, let's get some coding party started! :D
